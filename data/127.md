## Question: 
Can I swap plates on my vehicles?

## Answer: 
Swapping plates directly between vehicles is not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents. However, here are a few related details that might be helpful:

1. **Antique Plates**: If you have a vehicle of a model year 1973 or older, you can use original-issue license plates from the same year as the model year of the vehicle, provided the plate number is not currently assigned to another vehicle and does not conflict with a currently issued series. The original issue plates need to be verified by DMV staff [doc5].

2. **Foreign Vehicle Registration**: If you move to Utah from another state and establish residence, you might register your vehicle as a foreign vehicle without surrendering the out-of-state title if the title is held by a lien holder. This involves surrendering the vehicle’s current out-of-state registration [doc3].

3. **Special Plates**: Certain special plates, such as those for off-highway vehicles or Utah Highway Patrol vehicles, have specific usage restrictions and cannot be used interchangeably on different types of vehicles [doc1][doc4].

For specific guidance on whether you can swap plates between your particular vehicles, it is recommended to contact the Utah DMV directly.

## Confidence: 
Medium. The documents provide information on specific plate types and their regulations but do not explicitly cover general plate swapping between vehicles. Contacting the Utah DMV will give you the most accurate and applicable information for your situation.
