## Question: 
Is the information contained in a license application confidential?
## Answer: 
Yes, the information contained in a license application is considered confidential. According to Utah DMV policy, all motor vehicle records, including those in a license application, are classified as "protected." This means that the information can only be released to specific parties such as the subject of the record, their legal representative, law enforcement, and others as designated by law. The records are not available for commercial advertising use [doc1].
## Confidence: 
High
