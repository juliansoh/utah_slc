## Question: 
Can I renew my placards online?
## Answer: 
Yes, you can renew your disabled placards online. For placards that were issued before July 1, 2024, the DMV sends out renewal notices for permanent parking placards, which need only be signed and mailed back to the DMV. However, if you did not receive a renewal notice or it has been lost, you may renew your placard online, visit your local DMV office, or call the DMV to renew over the phone [doc1]. Additionally, for existing permanent placards, you can process your renewal online, and the DMV will mail the new placard to you [doc4].
## Confidence: 
High. The information directly references the Utah DMV's procedures for renewing disabled placards online, as detailed in the retrieved documents.
