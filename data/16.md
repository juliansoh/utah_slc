## Question:
Can I transfer a new vehicle into my name online?

## Answer:
Yes, you can transfer a vehicle into your name online in Utah through the Motor Vehicle Portal (MVP) using the Utah Person to Person (UPP) online title transfer service. To do this, you will need either the original title or a bill of sale from the previous owner. This should be sufficient to start the title/registration process and obtain a temporary permit while you gather any additional required ownership documents or complete necessary vehicle inspections [doc1][doc2].

If the vehicle has a Utah title, you can proceed with the online application. However, if the vehicle's title is from out-of-state, you will need to visit a DMV office in person, as out-of-state titles cannot be processed online [doc5].

## Confidence:
High. This information is directly extracted from the retrieved documents which detail the process and requirements for transferring vehicle titles online in Utah.
