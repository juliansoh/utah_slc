## Question:
What form do I submit for my vintage vehicle instead of insurance?

## Answer:
For a vintage vehicle that has a model year of 1983 or newer and is located in a county where emissions inspections are required, you need to provide proof of vehicle insurance that is specific to a collector vehicle. This can be done using form TC-745, the Vintage Vehicle Insurance Affidavit [doc1][doc2][doc5].

## Confidence:
High. The information is consistent across multiple documents retrieved, all specifying the requirement for form TC-745 for vintage vehicles needing specific insurance documentation.
