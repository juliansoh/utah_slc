## Question:
Do I need a title for a 1974 speedboat that is 15 feet long?

## Answer:
No, you do not need a title for a 1974 speedboat that is 15 feet long. According to the Utah DMV, every 1985 or newer watercraft operated in Utah waters must be titled, which means your 1974 speedboat does not fall under the titling requirement [doc4].

## Confidence:
High
**Reasoning:** The information clearly states that only watercraft from 1985 or newer need to be titled, which directly applies to the user’s 1974 speedboat.
