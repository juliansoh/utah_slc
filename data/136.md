## Question:
If I have a title in both mine and my wife's name but need to make changes do we both have to go to the DMV?

## Answer:
Whether both you and your wife need to go to the DMV depends on how the names are listed on the title. If the title lists your names with "and" between them, both of you must sign to transfer or change the title. If the title uses "or," only one of you needs to sign to make changes to the title [doc1][doc2].

## Confidence:
High
**Reasoning**: The information directly addresses the criteria for whether one or both owners need to be present or sign for changes based on the use of "and" or "or" on the title, as specified in the provided documents.
