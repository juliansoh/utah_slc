## Question:
Why does my vintage vehicle require emissions?

## Answer:
Your vintage vehicle may require an emissions inspection if it has a model year of 1983 or newer and is located in a county where emissions inspections are mandatory. According to Senate Bill 51, vintage vehicles with model years 1983 and newer must provide proof of an emissions inspection or proof of vehicle insurance specific to a collector vehicle at the time of registration in such counties [doc3][doc1][doc2].
