## Question: 
How do I request a Refund?
## Answer: 
To request a refund from the Utah DMV, follow these steps:

1. **Determine Eligibility**: Refunds are given only under specific circumstances, such as:
   - If you renewed a vehicle that was previously sold, you might be eligible for a refund if you provide a bill of sale with specific details and the sale date is prior to the renewal date [doc1].
   - If you paid renewal fees before the expiration date and the vehicle was sold, traded-in, or became inoperable before that date, you may be eligible for a refund if you request it within six months [doc1].

2. **Gather Required Documents**: Collect necessary documents to support your claim. This may include:
   - Bill of sale with details such as the date of sale, VIN, and information about the seller and purchaser.
   - Proof that the vehicle was inoperable or sold before the expiration date [doc1].

3. **Submit Your Claim**: Use Utah’s Motor Vehicle Portal (MVP) to submit your claim for a refund. Submission of a claim does not guarantee approval [doc1][doc3].

4. **Processing Time**: Once submitted, the Division will review your request and supporting documentation. If approved, a refund check will be issued to the address provided. If denied, you will receive a letter explaining the reason for the denial. The process typically takes 6-8 weeks [doc1][doc5].

5. **Refund of DUI Fee**: In specific cases, such as for a DUI impound, you might be eligible for a refund if you provide proof of duplicate payment, a stolen vehicle report, or a letter from the Driver License Division indicating that the driver's license will not be revoked or suspended [doc3].

For more detailed information, visit the Utah DMV's "Request a Refund" page on their website [doc1].
