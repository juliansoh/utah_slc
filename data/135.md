## Question: 
How can I change my mailing address to be received in another state?

To change your mailing address with the Utah DMV, you can use the Motor Vehicle Portal (MVP). However, please note that for security reasons, MVP and other e-services are not available in most countries outside the United States. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, you can contact the DMV at 801-297-7780 or via email at dmv@utah.gov [doc1][doc2][doc3].
## Confidence: 
High. This answer is based directly on the information provided in the retrieved documents, which outline the procedure for changing your address through the MVP and provide contact information for further assistance.
