## Question:
How do I go about obtaining a new title for a few vehicles that are in my father's name and he has passed away?

## Answer:
To obtain a new title for vehicles in your father's name after his passing, you will need to follow a specific process set by the Utah DMV. Here are the steps you generally need to follow:

1. **Provide a Death Certificate**: You will need to submit a copy of your father's death certificate as part of the documentation.

2. **Probate Court Documentation**: Depending on whether your father's estate is going through probate, you may need to provide court documents indicating the executor or administrator of the estate. This could be a letter of testamentary or a court order.

3. **Title Transfer Forms**:
   - **Form TC-656**: Complete the "Application for Utah Title" (Form TC-656). This form needs to be filled out by the new owner of the vehicle(s) [doc1][doc3].
   - **Form TC-569A**: If the title is unavailable, you may need to complete an "Ownership Statement" (Form TC-569A), explaining how you acquired the vehicle and why no title is available [doc3].

4. **Odometer Disclosure**: If the vehicles are less than 20 years old, you will need to complete the odometer disclosure section on the title or provide a properly completed Form TC-891, Odometer Disclosure Statement, signed by the owner and the buyer [doc1][doc4].

5. **Release of Lien**: If there is a lienholder listed on the title, ensure that the lienholder has released their lien. This is necessary before the vehicle can be transferred to the new owner [doc1].

6. **Emissions and Safety Inspections**: If you plan on registering the vehicles, you may need to provide safety and/or emissions inspection certificates, especially if you live in certain counties (Salt Lake, Davis, Weber, Cache, or Utah) [doc1][doc3][doc5].

7. **Pay Applicable Fees**: Be prepared to pay any applicable fees and taxes at the time of the title transfer. The exact amount will depend on the value of the vehicles and your local sales tax rate [doc2].

For more detailed guidance, you may want to visit the Utah DMV website or contact them directly. They can provide specific instructions based on your unique situation.
