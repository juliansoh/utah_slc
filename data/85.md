## Question: 
Does the Seller Need to Collect Sales Tax?
## Answer: 
In a private-party car sale in Utah, a seller (who is NOT a dealer) is not required to collect sales tax on the transaction. The purchaser will pay the sales tax at the time the vehicle is titled and registered at the Utah Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) [doc1].
## Confidence: 
High. The information is directly extracted from the retrieved document provided by the Utah DMV website.
