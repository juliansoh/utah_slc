## Question: 
How to get a title replacement?
## Answer: 
To obtain a replacement title in Utah, follow these steps:

1. **Online Request**:
   - You may request a duplicate title online using the Motor Vehicle Portal (MVP) [doc1].

2. **Mail Request**:
   - Complete Form TC-123, Application for Duplicate Utah Title.
   - Submit the form along with a $6.00 title fee to:
     ```
     Division of Motor Vehicles
     Mail and Correspondence
     P.O. Box 30412
     Salt Lake City, UT 84130
     ```
   - Important: Do not send cash by mail. Ensure checks or money orders are payable to the Utah State Tax Commission (USTC) [doc1].

3. **In-Person Request**:
   - You can also visit a local DMV office to request a duplicate title by completing Form TC-123 and paying the $6.00 title fee [doc2].

4. **Processing Time**:
   - Duplicate titles typically take approximately 10 to 14 business days to be processed and delivered [doc1].

If you are selling the vehicle to a Utah resident, you may give the completed Form TC-123 to the buyer in place of the original title. Ensure that both Part 1 and Part 2 of the form are signed. It is recommended that a bill of sale accompany the application for the duplicate title [doc1].
