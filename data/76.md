## Question:
When do I need to get a dealer’s license?

## Answer:
You need to obtain a dealer's license under Utah law if:

1. Your business, in whole or in part, involves selling new, used, or new and used motor vehicles.
2. You sell, display for sale, or offer for sale or exchange three or more new or used motor vehicles in any 12-month period.
3. You are a representative or consignee of any dealer. This means that if you sell cars on behalf of a dealer, you must also be licensed as a dealer.

These requirements ensure that individuals or entities engaging in the sale of motor vehicles adhere to the state's regulations and licensing standards [doc1].
