## Question:
Do I need to return the license plates to UT DMV when sold?

## Answer:
When you sell your vehicle, you should remove your license plates from the vehicle. If you do not remove the plates, you may be liable for any parking or traffic violations that occur while your plates remain on the car. However, the retrieved documents do not specify that you need to return the license plates to the Utah DMV.

## Confidence:
High. The information is directly extracted from the provided document, which advises removing the license plates but does not mention returning them to the DMV [doc2].
