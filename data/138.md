## Question: 
I lease my vehicle and do not have the title. Am I going to need it to register my car in Utah?

## Answer: 
If you lease your vehicle and do not have the title, you will not be required to obtain the certificate of title to transfer your vehicle registration to Utah. Instead, you will need to provide the following documents to receive a "Registration Only":

1. **Most recent registration**: A copy of your most recent vehicle registration.
2. **Leasing company or lien holder information**: The name and address of the leasing company or lien holder holding your certificate of title.
3. **Power of Attorney**: If the vehicle is leased, ensure the lessor provides their power of attorney, a billing statement, and their Utah sales tax number.
4. **Safety and/or Emissions Inspection Certificates**: Depending on the vehicle type and model year, a safety and/or emissions inspection may be required.
5. **VIN/HIN Inspection**: Inspections of identification numbers are required for all vehicles or vessels to be titled in Utah for the first time. Safety inspection certificates are acceptable means of verification for your cars, trucks, and motorcycles providing the VIN is accurate on the safety inspection certificate [doc3][doc5].

## Confidence: 
High. The response is based on specific requirements and instructions provided for leased vehicles without titles when registering in Utah.
