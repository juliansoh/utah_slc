## Question:
I hate junk mail! How do I stop getting these renewal postcards? Can this stuff not be emailed?

## Answer:
Yes, you can stop receiving renewal postcards and instead receive renewal reminders via email. To do this, you need to sign up for email renewal reminders on the Utah DMV website. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Visit the [Motor Vehicle Portal (MVP)](https://mvp.tax.utah.gov/).
2. Sign up for email renewal reminders by providing your email address and other necessary information.
3. Once registered, you will start receiving your renewal reminders via email instead of postcards.

This will help ensure you don't miss any renewal reminders and reduce the amount of physical mail you receive.
