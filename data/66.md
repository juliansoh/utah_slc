## Question:
I am a leasing company and my primary business is not selling vehicles. Do I need a dealer’s license?
## Answer:
Under Utah law, a "dealer" is defined as a person whose business, in whole or in part, involves selling new, used, or new and used motor vehicles, and who sells, displays for sale, or offers for sale or exchange three or more new or used motor vehicles in any 12-month period [doc2]. Therefore, if your leasing company engages in selling three or more vehicles within a 12-month period, you will be required to obtain a dealer's license [doc2].
