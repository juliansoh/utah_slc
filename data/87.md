## Question: 
I bought my car from a Dealer and haven't received my plates?
## Answer: 
When a dealer sells a vehicle to a Utah resident, they issue a 45-day temporary permit. This permit allows the dealer 45 days to obtain the registration and license plates from the Motor Vehicle Division [doc5]. If you have not received your plates within this period, you may want to follow up with the dealer to ensure there are no delays in processing your registration and plates.
## Confidence: 
High
- The information is directly cited from the retrieved document, which clearly outlines the process and timelines for receiving plates when purchasing a vehicle from a dealer.
