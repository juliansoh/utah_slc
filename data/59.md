## Question: 
Why should I use MVP?
## Answer: 
Using Utah's Motor Vehicle Portal (MVP) offers several advantages:

1. **Free**: There’s no cost to use MVP, though applicable fees for title, tax, and registration still apply [doc1].
2. **Convenient**: MVP is accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week, allowing you to avoid waiting in lines or on the phone [doc1].
3. **Secure**: MVP protects your information and provides a secure online experience, with identity verification through a self-created username and password [doc1].
4. **Environmentally Friendly**: Managing your vehicle accounts online reduces the need for paper [doc1].

Additionally, MVP allows you to perform various DMV and MVED functions, such as managing your vehicles, making DMV payments, ordering license plates, transferring titles, changing your address, and renewing disabled placards or a commercial fleet [doc1].
