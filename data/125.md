## Question:
Do I have to have Utah Insurance to register?

## Answer:
Yes, you are required to have Utah insurance to register a vehicle in Utah. According to Utah Code 31A-22-302, no-fault, bodily injury, and property damage liability coverage must be maintained on all passenger cars and trucks throughout the vehicle's registration period if the owner/operator is a resident of Utah. Additionally, non-residents who operate a motor vehicle that has been physically present in Utah for 90 days during the preceding 365 days are also required to maintain no-fault insurance while the vehicle remains in the state [doc2].

## Confidence:
High. The information is directly cited from the Utah DMV website, which specifies the insurance requirements for vehicle registration in Utah.
