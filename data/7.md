## Question:
How do I register an out of state vehicle?
## Answer:
To register an out-of-state vehicle in Utah, follow these steps:

1. **Surrender the Out-of-State Registration:**
   - You need to surrender the vehicle’s current out-of-state registration. A copy of the out-of-state registration is acceptable if you wish to retain dual registration in both states [doc2].

2. **Provide Necessary Documentation:**
   - If the title is held by a lien holder, you can register the vehicle as a foreign vehicle without surrendering the out-of-state title. You must provide the most recent registration and the information of the lien holder [doc2][doc5].

3. **Complete the Required Inspections:**
   - You must complete a Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) inspection and an emissions test. Ensure that you obtain the necessary safety and/or emissions inspection certificates as required based on the vehicle type and model year [doc2][doc5].

4. **Pay Applicable Fees and Taxes:**
   - You will need to clear property tax/age-based fee with the county assessor. Additionally, all required Utah registration fees and applicable taxes must be paid at the time of registration [doc2].

5. **Visit the DMV Office:**
   - Bring all the required documents, including proof of ownership, safety and/or emissions inspection certificates, and any other related forms to a local DMV office to complete the registration process [doc5].
