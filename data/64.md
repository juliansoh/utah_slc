## Question: 
What if a licensee loses or misplaces his license certificate or pocket card?
## Answer: 
If a licensee loses or misplaces their license certificate or pocket card, they can replace it by visiting their local DMV office with a copy of the most recent registration, license plate number, or Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). The fee for the replacement depends on the item being replaced. For example, replacing a standard plate costs $15.50, while a personalized plate costs $18.00. The replacement process can also be completed online through the Motor Vehicle Portal or by mail with a written request and a copy of the registration certificate [doc3].
