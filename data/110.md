## Question:
Can I get a replacement sticker?
## Answer:
Yes, you can get a replacement sticker (decal) for your vehicle. According to the Utah DMV, you can replace a lost or stolen decal by visiting your local DMV office with a copy of the most recent registration, license plate number, or Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). The fee for the replacement depends on the type of decal:

- Motor Vehicle Decal: $5.00
- Watercraft Decal: $7.00
- OHV License Plate Decal: $4.00
- Off-Highway MC/Snowmobile Decal: $8.00
- Camper Decal: $5.00

You can also order duplicate registrations and plate replacements online through the Motor Vehicle Portal or by mail. If you choose to request by mail, include an additional $7.75 for postage [doc1].

## Confidence:
High. The information is directly sourced from the Utah DMV website, which provides detailed instructions on how to replace decals.
