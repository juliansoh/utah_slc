## Question:
How to receive a current registration certificate for my car?

## Answer:
To receive a current registration certificate for your car in Utah, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Renewal Options**: You can renew your registration through various methods including online, by mail, or at a DMV office. Each method has specific requirements:
   - **Online**: Use the DMV's online renewal website, Renewal Express. You will need to have applicable inspection certificates and pay all associated registration fees. If your registration has expired within the last six months, you can also obtain a temporary permit online [doc5].
   - **By Mail**: Send the required documents along with payment to the Motor Vehicle Division at P.O. Box 30412, Salt Lake City, UT 84130. Make the check payable to the Utah State Tax Commission [doc2].
   - **In Person**: Visit any DMV office in Utah. Depending on the situation, you may need an appointment. It's important to bring the original title or a bill of sale from the previous owner, and ensure all taxes and fees are paid at the time of registration [doc2][doc4].

2. **Required Documents**: Regardless of the method, you will need:
   - Most recent vehicle registration certificate.
   - If applicable, emissions inspection certificates and safety inspection certificates, especially if you live in counties like Salt Lake, Davis, Weber, Cache, or Utah [doc1].
   - Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) inspection, which can be performed by a DMV employee, peace officer, licensed dealer, or certified safety inspector [doc4].

3. **Additional Steps for New Residents**: If you have recently moved to Utah, you have 60 days to transfer your title and registration. You will need the existing title and the most recent registration. A VIN inspection is also required [doc4].

4. **Contact Information**: For more details or to handle specific inquiries, you can contact the DMV at 801-297-7780 or 1-800-DMV-UTAH [doc4].
