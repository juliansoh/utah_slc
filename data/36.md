## Question: 
To determine if I need a safety inspection for a vehicle that is past due for a yearly update?
## Answer: 
Effective January 1, 2018, the State of Utah removed the safety inspection requirement for most vehicles as a prerequisite for registration [doc1]. However, certain vehicles still require safety inspections:

1. **Salvage vehicles that have been rebuilt and are requesting a rebuilt title** [doc5].
2. **First-time street legal ATV registrations**, including ownership transfers for previously registered street legal ATVs [doc5].
3. **Commercial vehicles** must obtain a safety inspection for display and presentation to law enforcement, but this is not a prerequisite for registration [doc5].
4. **Motor homes with three axles** are considered "Class 6" vehicles and require an annual safety inspection for display and presentation to law enforcement [doc5].

If your vehicle falls into any of these categories, a safety inspection will be required.
