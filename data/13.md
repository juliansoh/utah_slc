## Question: 
How do I get a temp tag?
## Answer: 
To obtain a temporary permit (temp tag) from the Utah DMV, you can follow one of several methods depending on your specific needs:

1. **Online via Renewal Express**: If your vehicle's registration has expired within the last six months, you can obtain a 30-day temporary permit through the Renewal Express website. This permit allows you time to complete the required safety and/or emissions inspections. Full registration fees and a $6.00 permit fee must be paid to receive and print the temporary permit [doc3].

2. **Motor Vehicle Portal (MVP)**: If you’ve purchased a used vehicle directly from the previous owner, you can use Utah’s Motor Vehicle Portal (MVP) to transfer the title and apply for a temporary permit. You will need the original title or a bill of sale from the previous owner to start this process. All taxes and applicable fees are due at the time of application for the permit [doc5].

3. **On the SPOT Renewal Stations**: Temporary permits can be obtained from participating On the Spot renewal stations, which will allow you 30 days to complete the vehicle’s safety and/or emissions inspections. Full registration fees and a $6.00 permit fee must be paid, and a convenience fee may also apply [doc4].

4. **DMV Office**: You can visit a local DMV office to obtain a temporary permit. Proof of ownership (like the title or bill of sale) and possibly proof of insurance will be required. Temporary permits can be issued for various lengths of time, ranging from 96 hours to 60 days, depending on your situation. Permit fees and lengths of validity vary [doc5].

5. **Impounded Vehicles**: If your vehicle has been impounded due to expired or improper registration, the DMV can issue a 30-day temporary permit along with the impound release after collecting the appropriate fees. This permit allows you time to complete the necessary inspections and registration [doc2].

For specific details and to ensure you have all necessary documentation, it's recommended to visit the Utah DMV website or contact your local DMV office.
