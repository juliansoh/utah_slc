## Question: 
How long is my emissions good for?
## Answer: 
The duration for which your emissions test is valid depends on the county in which your vehicle is registered and the model year of your vehicle:

1. **Salt Lake County, Davis County, Utah County**:
   - Vehicles less than six years old: Emission tests are required once every two years. Vehicles with even-numbered model years require tests in even-numbered years, and vehicles with odd-numbered model years require tests in odd-numbered years [doc1][doc2][doc3].

2. **Specific Requirements for Model Years**:
   - Vehicles from 2018 to 1968: Emission tests are required annually.
   - Vehicles 1967 and older: Emission tests are not required [doc1][doc2][doc3].

For a detailed breakdown of the requirements based on specific vehicle model years, you can refer to the respective county guidelines provided in the documents.
