## Question:
If I reconstruct my vehicle with two different year vehicles, what year will my vehicle end up being?

## Answer:
When you reconstruct a vehicle using parts from two different year vehicles, the year of your reconstructed vehicle will be determined by what the vehicle looks like after the reconstruction. For example, if you mount a 1998 Ford pickup body onto a 1997 Ford pickup frame, the vehicle will be classified as a 1998 Ford. The model year will be based on the appearance of the vehicle after reconstruction [doc1].

## Confidence:
High. This information is directly retrieved from the Utah DMV documentation regarding the titling and registration of reconstructed vehicles [doc1].
