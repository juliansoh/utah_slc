## Question: 
I have a standard skier plate and love my plate number. Can I order the same plate number but on the B&W plates?

## Answer: 
No, you cannot order the same plate number on a different plate type. The combination of letters and numbers requested cannot duplicate a currently registered license plate or conflict with a series or the letter/number combinations used on regular issue license plates [doc4].

## Confidence: 
High
- Reasoning: The retrieved documents clearly state that duplicate combinations of letters and numbers are not permitted for different plate types.
