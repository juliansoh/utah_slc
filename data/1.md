## Question: 
How do I renew my vehicle?
## Answer: 
To renew your vehicle in Utah, you have several options:

1. **Renewal Express**: You can renew your vehicle online using the Renewal Express service. This method is convenient and free of charge [doc1].

2. **On the SPOT**: Many inspection stations in Utah participate in the On the SPOT (OTS) program. At these stations, you can get your vehicle inspected, renew your registration, and obtain your new plate decal immediately. Most stations charge a minimal fee for this service [doc4]. You can find the nearest OTS station using the OTS Station Map [doc4].

3. **Drive-Through**: The DMV processes renewals via drive-through at specific locations including Salt Lake, South Valley, Ogden, and Hurricane [doc3]. Note that the Farmington drive-through location is temporarily closed [doc3].

4. **By Mail**: If you prefer to renew by mail, send the necessary documents and payment to:
   ```
   Motor Vehicle Division
   P.O. Box 30412
   Salt Lake City, UT 84130
   ```
   Make the check payable to the Utah State Tax Commission. Ensure to include applicable inspection certificates and registration fees [doc3].

Some registration renewals may require an in-person visit, especially if your renewal has been expired for more than six months or if you qualify for an abatement. In such cases, schedule an appointment using the online Appointment Scheduler [doc1][doc3].
