## Question:
Can I renew my registration online if I didn't register the vehicle last year?

## Answer:
No, you cannot renew your registration online if your renewal has been expired for over 6 months. In such cases, you are required to visit a DMV office in person to complete the renewal process [doc1].

## Confidence:
High
- The retrieved document explicitly states that some registration renewals require an in-person visit, including cases where the renewal has been expired for over 6 months [doc1].
