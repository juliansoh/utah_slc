## Question:
How much do I need to pay for sales tax on a gifted vehicle?

## Answer:
In Utah, sales tax is due on vehicle sales between family members, and there is no exemption for family-to-family vehicle purchases. The amount of sales tax you need to pay is based on the purchase price, which includes any value of the consideration given, such as cash payments, loan payoffs, and trades [doc1]. The purchase price you claim on documents when registering your vehicle must state the price you actually paid, and the documents will be reviewed for accuracy by the Tax Commission [doc3].

If the vehicle was gifted and there was no monetary exchange, you may need to verify this information directly with the Utah DMV to determine the exact tax obligations, as the typical process involves calculating sales tax based on the net purchase price or fair market value when a purchase price is not provided [doc2].

## Confidence:
Medium
**Reasoning:** The documents provide detailed information on sales tax for vehicle purchases, including family-to-family transactions, but they do not specifically address the scenario of a gifted vehicle. Verifying with the Utah DMV is recommended to ensure all obligations are met correctly.
