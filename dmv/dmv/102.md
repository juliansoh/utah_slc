## Question:
I bought a 2009 camper off of KSL and the owner did not have a title. They said it wasn't required. Is that true?

## Answer:
According to the Utah DMV, campers with the model year 2015 and newer require a title to be issued. Since your camper is a 2009 model, it does not require a title. However, the camper must still be registered, and a current camper decal must be affixed to the vehicle. There is no fee for camper registration, but property fees must be paid as part of the registration transaction [doc1].

## Confidence:
High. The information directly addresses the requirement for titling based on the year of the camper model, which is clearly stated in the retrieved document.
