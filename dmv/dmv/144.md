## Question:
As an authorized carrier, does my trailer dolly require a separate registration?
## Answer:
According to the Utah DMV guidelines, every trailer operated in Utah, including travel and tent trailers, weighing more than 750 lbs, must be titled and registered [doc3]. There is no specific mention of trailer dollies in the retrieved documents, but if your trailer dolly falls under the category of trailers weighing more than 750 lbs, it would require registration.

## Confidence:
Medium
- The information is directly referenced from the retrieved documents, but there is no explicit mention of trailer dollies. Therefore, this interpretation is based on the general requirements for trailers.
