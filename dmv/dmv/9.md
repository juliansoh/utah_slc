## Question:
Do I have to wait if I have a bill of sale?

## Answer:
If you have a bill of sale, you typically do not have to wait to begin the process of titling and registering your vehicle. According to the Utah DMV, a bill of sale can be used to start the title and registration process, and you may obtain a temporary permit while you gather any additional required documents such as safety and emissions inspections [doc3]. This allows you to legally operate the vehicle while completing the necessary steps to finalize the title and registration process.
