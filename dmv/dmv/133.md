## Question: 
Do I have to have an appointment to go to the DMV?
## Answer: 
While many services can be completed online or through other methods, certain transactions at the Utah DMV may require an appointment. Here are some key points:

1. **Online Services**: Many DMV services, such as registration renewals, can be completed online through Renewal Express or at an On the SPOT renewal station [doc2][doc3]. Other services available online include changing your address, applying for a duplicate title, and ordering license plates [doc2].

2. **Appointment Requirement**: If your transaction requires you to visit an office, you may need to schedule an appointment. This includes services such as title and registration, impound release, and insurance reinstatement [doc2]. Specific offices that require appointments include Ogden, Farmington, Salt Lake, South Valley, Provo, and Hurricane [doc2].

3. **Exceptions**: Some registration renewals require an in-person visit, such as when the renewal has been expired for over 6 months or you qualify for an abatement [doc2]. In these cases, you should schedule an appointment online.

4. **Office Locations and Contact**: For general DMV inquiries, you can call 1-800-DMV-UTAH (800-368-8824). You can visit any DMV office in the state for motor vehicle business, but it is advisable to check business hours and appointment requirements beforehand [doc4].
