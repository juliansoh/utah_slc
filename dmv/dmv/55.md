## Question: 
How can I get my renewal information?
## Answer: 
You can get your renewal information through the Utah DMV's Motor Vehicle Portal (MVP). By entering your last name, zip code, license plate number, and the last four digits of your Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), you will receive the same information that would have been sent on your renewal notice, including your Renewal Express PIN, renewal fee, and inspection requirements [doc2]. 

Additionally, you can access your registration renewal information, including your online renewal PIN, by visiting the Utah DMV's renewal page [doc1].

## Confidence: 
High
The information directly addresses how to access renewal information and is cited from the Utah DMV's official documents.
