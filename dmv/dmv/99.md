## Question: 
Will my plate be mailed or do I need to pick it up?
## Answer: 
Your plate will be mailed to you. For personalized plates, once your application is approved and the plates are manufactured, they will be mailed to the designated mailing address on the motor vehicle database ([doc1]). For other special group plates, such as the Martin Luther King plate and the Historic Black & White plate, they are also centrally distributed and will be mailed from the Utah State Tax Commission upon order ([doc3], [doc4]).
