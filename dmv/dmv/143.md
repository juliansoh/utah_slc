## Question:
I'm a Louisiana resident stationed at Hill Air Force Base for the next two years. I am purchasing a vehicle to use while I am stationed here. Am I exempt from Sales Tax as an out of state resident?

## Answer:
No, as a nonresident military personnel stationed in Utah, you are not exempt from sales tax when purchasing a vehicle in Utah. You must pay the sales/use tax on the vehicle if you plan to operate it in Utah, even if you choose to register the vehicle in your home state [doc2].

## Confidence:
High. The information is directly obtained from the Utah DMV guidelines for nonresident military personnel.
