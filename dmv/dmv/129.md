## Question:
How do I take a name off of my title?

## Answer:
To remove a name from your title in Utah, follow these steps:

1. **Surrender the Existing Title**: You must surrender the existing title to the DMV.
2. **Complete the Required Form**: Fill out Form TC-656, Application for Utah Title, with the appropriate changes reflecting the removal of the name. At least one owner whose name was already on the title before changes were made must sign this application.
3. **Fees**: A $6.00 title fee and a $4.00 duplicate registration fee may apply.
4. **Lien Holder**: If your title is being held by a lien holder as collateral in a financing agreement, you may need to contact the lien holder to have the title sent to the DMV before changes can be made.

These steps ensure that the title is properly updated to reflect the change in ownership.
