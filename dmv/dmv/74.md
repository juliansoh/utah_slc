## Question:
How do I get a Dealer plate?
## Answer:
To obtain a Dealer plate in Utah, the following steps and requirements must be met:

1. **Eligibility**: Dealer plates are typically issued to vehicle dealers. When a dealer sells a vehicle to a Utah resident, they can issue a 45-day temporary permit. This allows the dealer 45 days to obtain the registration and license plates from the Motor Vehicle Division [doc1].

2. **Application Process**: The detailed process for obtaining a dealer plate might involve specific forms and documentation, which are not explicitly covered in the retrieved documents. You would typically need to contact the Utah DMV or visit their official website for the exact forms and additional steps required.

3. **Contact Information**: For more information or to start the application process, you can contact the Utah DMV at 801-297-7780 or 1-800-DMV-UTAH (800-368-8824) [doc5].

## Confidence:
**Medium**. The retrieved documents provide general information on dealer plates and temporary permits issued by dealers but do not detail the complete process for obtaining a dealer plate. For a comprehensive guide, it is advisable to directly consult the Utah DMV.
