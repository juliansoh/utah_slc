## Question: 
What to do with old license plates?
## Answer: 
When dealing with old license plates in Utah, you have several options:

1. **Collector License Plates:** You can purchase sample plates for collection purposes. To do this, complete Form TC-586, Collector License Plate Order, and mail it with a check or money order to the Utah State Tax Commission [doc2].

2. **Antique Plates:** If you have a vehicle model year 1973 or older, you can display original-issue license plates from the same year as the vehicle's model year. These plates need to be brought to a Motor Vehicle Office for verification to ensure they are authentic and do not conflict with existing series. If they cannot be used for registration purposes due to a conflict, you can apply for special antique plate decals [doc5].

3. **Historic Black & White Plates:** If you own a vehicle model year 1982 or older, you can apply for a historic black & white plate. For vehicles newer than 1983, they cannot be registered as vintage to obtain this plate. The plate can be personalized and is available for motorcycles as well [doc1].
