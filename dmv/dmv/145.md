## Question:
Good afternoon, I am the senior sales executive of Larry H Miller Toyota. We are looking to donate a vehicle to the National Kidney Foundation of Utah and Idaho. I'm trying to assist them with their paperwork and want to make sure that sales tax is exempt. Can you please confirm?

## Answer:
The retrieved documents do not provide specific information on whether donations to charitable organizations like the National Kidney Foundation of Utah and Idaho are exempt from sales tax. Generally, sales tax in Utah is based on the purchase price and includes all forms of consideration, such as cash payments and trades, and there is no exemption for family-to-family vehicle purchases [doc1][doc2][doc3]. 

However, for precise information regarding exemptions for charitable donations, I recommend contacting the Utah DMV directly. You can reach them at (801) 297-7780 or 1-800-DMV-UTAH (800-368-8824) for detailed guidance on your specific situation [doc1].

## Confidence:
High. The retrieved documents extensively cover sales tax policies but do not specifically mention exemptions for vehicle donations to charitable organizations, making it prudent to seek direct clarification from the DMV.
