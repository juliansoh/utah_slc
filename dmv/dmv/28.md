## Question:
I need to get a PIN number to get my vehicle renewed?

## Answer:
No, a PIN number is not required to renew your vehicle registration using Renewal Express. You can complete your registration renewal by entering your last name, zip code, license plate number, and the last eight digits of your VIN. These details can be found on a previous registration [doc2].

## Confidence:
High
**Reasoning:** The information is directly retrieved from the Utah DMV document which explicitly states that a PIN is not required for vehicle registration renewal using Renewal Express.
