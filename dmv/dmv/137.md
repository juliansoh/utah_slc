## Question:
Can I just pick up my title at the office?

## Answer:
No, you cannot simply pick up your title at the office. Title processing has specific requirements depending on your situation:

1. **For Utah Titles**: The seller must provide you with either the original certificate of title or a completed Form TC-123, Application for Duplicate Utah Title. You need to bring this along with other necessary documents to the DMV to process the title transfer [doc1].

2. **For Out-of-State Titles**: You must visit a DMV office to handle the title transfer as out-of-state titles cannot be processed online [doc2].

3. **General DMV Services**: The offices provide various services including title application without ownership documentation, but appointments are highly encouraged to save time [doc5].
