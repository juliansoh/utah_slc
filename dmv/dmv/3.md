## Question:
How to exchange my current Utah plates with Antique Utah plates?
## Answer:
To exchange your current Utah plates for Antique Utah plates, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Eligibility**: Ensure your vehicle is of a model year 1973 or older. Only vehicles of this age can display original-issue license plates issued during the same year as the model year of the vehicle [doc1].

2. **Verification**: Bring the original-issue plates to a Motor Vehicle Office for verification. The DMV staff will check the plates to ensure they are authentic and do not conflict with an existing series. There is no special application form required for this process [doc1].

3. **Conflict Resolution**: If the plate number conflicts with a currently-issued plate series, you can apply for special antique plate decals. To do this, you must:
   - Submit the antique (original issue) plate to a Motor Vehicle Office for verification.
   - Submit a current registration card.
   - Pay a $5.00 fee. Note that antique decals expire every December, and the yearly renewal fee is also $5.00 [doc1].

4. **No Fee**: There is no fee for placing an original issue plate on a vehicle if the plate number does not conflict with a currently issued series [doc1].

5. **Affidavit for Selling**: If you sell a vehicle with original issue plates assigned to it, you may also sell the plate by completing an affidavit relinquishing the plates [doc1].

## Confidence:
High. The steps provided are directly extracted from the Utah DMV documentation regarding the process for using antique plates on eligible vehicles. The information is specific and detailed, ensuring clarity in the process [doc1].
