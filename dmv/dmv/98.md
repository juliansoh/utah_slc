## Question:
Why do I need a 2290?
## Answer:
You need IRS Form 2290, also known as the "Heavy Highway Vehicle Use Tax Return," if you operate a power unit with a registered weight over 54,000 lbs GVW (Gross Vehicle Weight). This form must be submitted to the IRS, and the most current stamped copy of Schedule 1 from Form 2290 must be returned to the DMV for your vehicle's registration.

Here are the reasons you need Form 2290:
1. **Heavy Vehicle Use Tax Compliance**: The form is required to comply with the federal heavy vehicle use tax regulations [doc1].
2. **Registration Requirement**: For vehicles registered over 55,000 lbs, it is necessary for the registration process [doc3].
3. **Proof of Payment**: You must provide the most current stamped copy of Schedule 1 to demonstrate that the tax has been paid [doc1].

You can obtain Form 2290 from the IRS website or a local IRS office. Note that you need to make an appointment before visiting an IRS office by calling 844-545-5640 [doc1].
