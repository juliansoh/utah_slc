## Question: 
My son is going to BYU in the fall. Does he need to register his car in Utah?
## Answer: 
Your son, as a nonresident student attending Brigham Young University (BYU) in Utah, does not necessarily need to register his car in Utah. He may maintain his out-of-state registration if he is currently registered full-time at a college, university, or other accredited educational institution in Utah and is paying nonresident tuition [doc2]. However, he has the option to register his vehicle in Utah if he prefers, in which case all required Utah fees and inspections would apply [doc2].
## Confidence: 
High. The information is directly retrieved from the Utah DMV website that outlines the requirements and options for nonresident students attending educational institutions in Utah.
