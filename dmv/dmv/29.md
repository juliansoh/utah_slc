## Question:
Why didn't I receive a renewal notice?
## Answer:
The Utah DMV offers two ways to receive your registration renewal reminder: by email or by receiving a postcard mailer. If you did not receive your renewal notice, it may be due to an outdated address or a preference not being set. To ensure you receive future reminders, verify and update your address and notification preference on the Motor Vehicle Portal (MVP) [doc1][doc2].

## Confidence:
High
**Reasoning:** The response is directly supported by the retrieved documents which clearly state the reasons for not receiving a renewal notice and provide guidance on how to ensure future notices are received.
