## Question:
"My vehicle will not pass inspection, what are my options?"

## Answer:
If your vehicle will not pass the required inspection, here are some options available to you:

1. **Temporary Permit**: If your vehicle has been impounded for expired registration and cannot pass inspection while impounded, you may be eligible for a 30-day temporary permit. This permit allows you to complete the required inspections after the vehicle is released. To obtain this permit, you must complete all necessary title/registration forms, submit the required documents, and pay all fees, including the permit fee [doc2].

2. **Deferral**: If you are a Utah resident temporarily residing out-of-state, you may be eligible for an emissions inspection deferral from your county of residence. The required deferral forms and submission requirements are available on the respective county websites. Once approved, you can complete your renewal online or submit it to the DMV [doc5].

3. **Repair and Reinspection**: You can choose to have the necessary repairs done to bring your vehicle up to the required standards. After repairs, the vehicle can be reinspected to ensure it meets the inspection requirements [doc5].

4. **Release to a Towing Company**: If the necessary repairs are too extensive, you may choose to release the vehicle to a licensed towing company to tow it to private property. However, all title and registration fees, impound fees, and related penalties must be paid before the vehicle is released [doc2].

## Confidence:
High. The options provided are directly referenced from the Utah DMV documents outlining procedures for vehicles that fail inspection and the available permits and deferrals .
