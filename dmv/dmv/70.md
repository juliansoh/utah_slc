## Question:
Once I have a license, will it be automatically renewed if I submit a renewal application and fee?

## Answer:
No, a driver's license in Utah is not automatically renewed just by submitting a renewal application and fee. While the documents provide detailed information about automatic vehicle registration renewals, they do not mention any automatic renewal process for driver licenses. You may need to visit the DMV or complete specific renewal steps as outlined by the DMV procedures.

## Confidence:
High
**Reasoning**: The retrieved documents do not mention an automatic renewal process for driver's licenses, but they do mention various processes for vehicle registration renewals, indicating that automatic renewals pertain to vehicle registration only and not to driver's licenses.
