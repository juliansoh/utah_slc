## Question: 
How do I get a rebuilt title?
## Answer: 
To obtain a rebuilt title in Utah, follow these steps:

1. **Complete the Necessary Forms**:
   - Fill out Form TC-569A (Ownership Statement), explaining how essential parts were acquired and how the vehicle was constructed, including the completion date.
   - Complete Form TC-162 (Application for Utah Motor Vehicle Identification Number) and Form TC-656 (Application for Utah Title) [doc1].

2. **Provide Documentation**:
   - Submit the title(s) of the vehicle(s) from which essential parts were used. If the titles are not available, provide an Ownership Statement explaining why.
   - Submit original bills of sale and receipts for parts used in the construction of the vehicle. Keep copies for your records [doc1].

3. **Obtain Inspections**:
   - Provide pictures showing the condition of the interior and all sides of the exterior of the vehicle.
   - Obtain a safety inspection and emissions inspection if applicable. Vehicles with engines from 1967 or older do not require an emissions test [doc1].

4. **VIN Inspection**:
   - Have the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) inspected by an authorized agent using Form TC-661 (Certificate of Inspection). This may be done by a DMV employee, designated contractor, Utah peace officer, designated enforcement agency employee, licensed dealer, or certified safety inspector. Note that this may require more than one visit [doc1][doc3].

5. **Payment of Fees**:
   - Ensure all other title and registration requirements are met, including the payment of fees and sales tax. Sales tax is due on the amount paid for all parts, except those on which sales tax has already been paid [doc1].

Following these steps will help you get a rebuilt title for your vehicle in Utah.
