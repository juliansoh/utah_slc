## Question:
I'm out of state and need to renew my registration, what if my vehicle requires emissions?

## Answer:
If you are a Utah resident temporarily residing outside of Utah and your vehicle requires an emission inspection, you may still register your vehicle at your permanent Utah address. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. **Emission Inspection Requirement**: For vehicles that need an emission inspection, you will need to see if you qualify for a deferment. For example, if you are a Salt Lake County resident temporarily residing outside of Utah, you may be eligible for a deferment from Salt Lake County [doc1][doc4].

2. **Online Renewal**: Many vehicle registration renewals can be completed online. You can use the Renewal Express service to obtain a temporary permit, which will allow you 30 days to operate the vehicle while you complete the emission inspection and other necessary documentation [doc2].

3. **Required Documentation**: Ensure you have the necessary documentation such as proof of ownership, vehicle safety inspection certificates (if required), and vehicle emission certificates (if required) [doc2].

4. **Permanent Utah Address**: You can register your vehicle at your permanent Utah address even if you are out of state. This applies to resident students, military personnel, and other Utah residents temporarily out of state [doc1].

## Confidence:
High. The information has been directly retrieved from the Utah DMV documents outlining the procedures and requirements for out-of-state residents needing to renew their vehicle registration and handle emission inspections. The steps and conditions are clearly specified in multiple sections of the documents [doc1][doc2][doc4].
