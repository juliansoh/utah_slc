## Question:
Do I need to get a safety inspection every year when renewing my side by side?
## Answer:
No, you do not need to get a safety inspection every year for your side by side (street legal ATV) when renewing its registration. A safety inspection is required only for the first-time registration or when there is an ownership transfer of a previously registered street legal ATV [doc1].
## Confidence:
High
**Reasoning**: The information is directly extracted from the relevant Utah DMV document, which specifies the requirements for street legal ATVs.
