## Question: 
I'm visiting Utah from Idaho and will be bringing my snowmobile. Do I need to register the snowmobile in Utah?

No, you do not need to register your snowmobile in Utah if it is owned and operated by a non-resident of Utah. Snowmobiles owned and operated by non-residents are exempt from registration requirements in Utah [doc1].
## Confidence: 
High
