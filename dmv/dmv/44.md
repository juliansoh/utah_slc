## Question:
Can I register my new car online?
## Answer:
No, you cannot register a new car online in Utah. While many registration renewals and other DMV services can be completed online, the initial registration of a new vehicle typically requires an in-person visit to a DMV office to complete the necessary paperwork and inspections. For more information, you may refer to the Utah DMV website or contact your local DMV office.
