## Question:
I have an apportioned truck, how do I get an emissions out of state?

## Answer:
For residents temporarily residing outside of Utah who need to get an emissions inspection for their vehicle, the process generally involves obtaining a deferment from the relevant county. Here are the steps you should take:

1. **Identify Your County of Registration**: Determine which county in Utah your truck is registered in (e.g., Salt Lake County, Weber County, Cache County, etc.).

2. **Contact the County**: Each county has specific requirements and forms for obtaining an emissions inspection deferment. Visit the respective county's website or contact them directly:
    - **Salt Lake County**: You may be eligible for a deferment, and the emission inspection or county deferral must be transmitted to the DMV prior to registration being completed [doc1].
    - **Weber County**: Visit the Weber County website to review requirements and obtain forms for submission [doc2].
    - **Cache County**: The emission inspection or county deferral must be transmitted from Cache County to the DMV prior to registration [doc2].

3. **Submit Required Forms**: Follow the instructions provided by your county to submit the necessary forms and documentation for deferment.

4. **Transmission to DMV**: Ensure that the emission inspection or county deferral is transmitted to the DMV before completing the registration process [doc1][doc2][doc3][doc4].
