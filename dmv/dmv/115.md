## Question:
I have a small motorcycle that is 175 cc's. Can I register it as a small motor vehicle?

## Answer:
No, you cannot register your 175 cc motorcycle as a small motor vehicle. According to the Utah DMV, a small motor vehicle is defined as a motor vehicle that has an engine with 150 or less cubic centimeters (cc) or a motor that produces five or less horsepower (hp) [doc3]. Since your motorcycle exceeds 150 cc, it does not qualify as a small motor vehicle.

## Confidence:
High
- The definition of a small motor vehicle is clearly stated in the provided document, specifying the maximum engine size and horsepower. Your motorcycle's engine capacity of 175 cc exceeds this limit.
