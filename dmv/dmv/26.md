## Question:
I just bought a vehicle, but the seller lost the title. What can I do?

## Answer:
If the seller has lost the title for a vehicle you just purchased, here are the steps you can follow:

1. **Seller Applies for Duplicate Title**: The seller needs to apply for a duplicate title. If the title was a Utah title, the seller can complete Form TC-123, Application for Duplicate Utah Title. This form not only requests a duplicate title but also allows the seller to transfer that duplicate title to you [doc2], [doc3].

2. **Temporary Permit**: While waiting for the duplicate title, you can take a bill of sale to the DMV and obtain a temporary permit, which allows you to use the vehicle during the waiting period [doc3], [doc4].

3. **Out-of-State Titles**: If the previous title was from out-of-state, the seller is responsible for obtaining a duplicate title from that state. During this period, you can take a bill of sale to the DMV, pay the title and registration fees, and obtain a temporary permit [doc2], [doc4].

4. **Document Submission**: As part of the online application process, you will be asked to upload ownership documents. If additional documentation is needed, you will receive an email checklist letting you know what documents are required to complete your transaction [doc3].

## Confidence:
High. The instructions are directly from the Utah DMV guidelines and provide comprehensive steps for dealing with a lost vehicle title situation, including obtaining a duplicate title and temporary permit [doc2], [doc3], [doc4].
