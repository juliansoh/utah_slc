## Question: 
I just bought a little trailer from Harbor Freight. Do I need to register it?
## Answer: 
Yes, you will need to register your trailer if it weighs more than 750 lbs. According to the Utah DMV, every trailer operated in Utah, including travel and tent trailers, that weighs more than 750 lbs must be titled and registered. You will need to pay a registration fee at the time of initial registration and annually thereafter. Uniform fees also apply [doc5].

## Confidence: 
High
- The retrieved document explicitly states the requirements for registering trailers, including the weight threshold and necessary fees.
