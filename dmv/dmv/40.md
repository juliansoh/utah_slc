## Question: 
Why can't my 1983 be vintage and get the Black and white plate?
## Answer: 
Your 1983 vehicle cannot be registered as vintage and get the Historic Black & White plate because the Historic Black & White plate is available to any model year vehicle **except vehicles with model year 1983 and newer registered as vintage** [doc1]. Vintage vehicles are defined as those that are at least 30 years old and are primarily collectors' items [doc3]. However, if you wish to obtain the Historic Black & White plate, your 1983 vehicle cannot be registered as vintage [doc1].
## Confidence: 
High
**Reasoning**: The information directly addresses the restriction on vehicles from the year 1983 and newer regarding the Historic Black & White plate and is consistent across multiple documents.
