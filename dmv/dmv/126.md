## Question: 
Do I need Utah ID to register?
## Answer: 
To register a vehicle in Utah, you do not need to provide a Utah ID specifically. Instead, you will need to provide several documents, including:

- The vehicle title.
- A completed Form TC-656, Utah Title Application.
- Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) inspection, if the vehicle is being titled in Utah for the first time.
- Safety and emission certificates, if required.
- Payment of registration and uniform fees [doc1][doc4].

Additionally, for leased vehicles, a Power of Attorney from the leasing company is required [doc4].
## Confidence: 
High
**Reasoning:** The information is directly extracted from the Utah DMV documents, which detail the requirements for vehicle registration. The documents do not mention the necessity of a Utah ID specifically for registration purposes.
