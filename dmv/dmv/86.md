## Question: 
"I bought a car and only got a bill of sale, how do I get my title?"
## Answer: 
If you bought a car and only have a bill of sale, you can still begin the process to obtain a title. Here are the steps you should follow:

1. **Temporary Permit and Additional Documentation**: You should at least have the original title or a bill of sale from the previous owner. Either of these should be sufficient to get your title/registration process started at the DMV, and should allow you to obtain a temporary permit while you round up additional documents such as safety and emissions inspections ([doc3]).

2. **Application for Duplicate Title**: If the seller can't find the title, they may complete Form TC-123, Application for Duplicate Utah Title. This form not only requests a duplicate title but also allows the seller to transfer that duplicate title to you. You can then take the Application for Duplicate Utah Title to the DMV along with your bill of sale ([doc3], [doc2]).

3. **Out-of-State Titles**: If the title was from out-of-state, the seller is responsible for obtaining a duplicate title from that state. In such cases, you may take your bill of sale to the DMV, pay your title and registration fees, and obtain a temporary permit so you can use the vehicle while you wait for the title ([doc3], [doc2]).

4. **Bill of Sale Requirements**: Ensure that your bill of sale includes the name and address of the buyer and seller, the complete vehicle description including the VIN, the purchase price, and any trade-in allowance if applicable ([doc1]).

## Confidence: 
High. The steps provided are directly from the Utah DMV guidelines on handling vehicle title transfers and applying for duplicate titles when the original is not available ([doc1], [doc2], [doc3]).
