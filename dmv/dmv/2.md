## Question:
How to register a private purchase rec vehicle?

## Answer:
To register a recreational vehicle (rec vehicle) purchased privately in Utah, follow these steps:

1. **Obtain a Bill of Sale:**
   - Ensure the bill of sale includes the name and address of the buyer, the name, address, and signature of the seller, a complete vehicle description (including the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)), description of any trade-in, purchase price, trade-in allowance (if applicable), and net purchase price [doc5].

2. **Ensure a Negotiable Title:**
   - Obtain a negotiable title from the seller at the time of sale. Verify that the title belongs to the vehicle being purchased, is properly signed off by the seller (both parties if needed), and ensure any lien holder has released their interest [doc5].

3. **Complete Required Forms:**
   - Form TC-569A, Ownership Statement, explaining how essential parts were acquired and the construction of the vehicle (if applicable).
   - Form TC-162, Application for Utah Motor Vehicle Identification Number.
   - Form TC-656, Application for Utah Title [doc1].

4. **Prepare Additional Documents:**
   - Original bills of sale and receipts for parts used in construction (if applicable).
   - Pictures of the vehicle showing the condition of the interior and all sides of the exterior [doc1].

5. **Safety and Emissions Inspections:**
   - Obtain a safety inspection certificate and emission inspection certificate if required. Vehicles with 1967 or older engines do not require an emission test. Obtain a waiver from the local county emissions office if necessary [doc1].

6. **VIN Inspection:**
   - Have the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) inspected by a police officer or a DMV-CSR [doc1].

7. **Pay Fees and Taxes:**
   - Pay all necessary fees and sales tax. Sales tax is due on the amount paid for all parts unless already paid [doc1].

8. **Affix Assigned ID Number:**
   - Once all requirements are met, you will receive a Utah Official ID number for the vehicle. Follow the DMV instructions to affix the assigned ID number to the vehicle [doc1].

After completing these steps, the vehicle will be registered, and the title will reflect the make of the vehicle as "SPCN" (specially constructed), with the year determined by the date construction was completed.
