## Question: 
"I have a triple wide mobile home, but I only received one title. Shouldn't I have received 3?"

## Answer: 
For multiple unit manufactured/mobile homes, such as a double-wide or triple-wide, only one Utah title will be issued. Therefore, it is correct that you received only one title for your triple wide mobile home. Customers are required to surrender all Manufacturer's Statements of Origin (MSOs) or previous titles for the individual units, but only one consolidated title will be issued by the Utah DMV.

## Confidence: 
High. This information is directly stated in the document regarding mobile and manufactured homes from the Utah DMV website [doc1].
