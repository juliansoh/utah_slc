## Question: 
How to renew a Disabled placard?

## Answer: 
To renew a disabled placard in Utah, follow these steps based on the type of placard you hold:

1. **Permanent Placards Issued Before July 1, 2024**: 
   - The DMV will send out renewal notices for permanent parking placards. 
   - Simply sign and mail back the renewal notice to the DMV.
   - The DMV will then mail the new (non-expiring) placards to you.
   - If a renewal notice wasn’t received or has been lost, you may renew online, visit your local DMV office, or call the DMV at (801) 297-7780 or 1-800-368-8824 to renew the placard over the phone [doc3].

2. **Permanent Placards Issued After July 1, 2024**: 
   - These placards do not expire and thus do not require renewal [doc3].

3. **Temporary Placards**: 
   - Temporary placards are valid for up to six months and cannot be renewed. 
   - Should your temporary disability continue past six months, you may apply for another temporary placard by obtaining a new physician’s certification [doc4].

In summary, for permanent placards issued before July 1, 2024, the renewal can be done by mail using the renewal notice, online, or by contacting the DMV. Temporary placards require a new application if the disability continues beyond six months.
