## Question:
Do I need a Safety for my Motorcycle?

## Answer:
Motorcycles are required to have a Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) inspection if they are being titled in Utah for the first time, unless the motorcycle is new and was acquired from an in-state dealer or in-state manufacturer [doc2]. However, there is no specific mention that motorcycles need an annual safety inspection as a prerequisite for registration [doc1][doc2].

## Confidence:
High
- The retrieved documents clearly state the conditions under which inspections are required for motorcycles, and there is no indication that an annual safety inspection is necessary for registration purposes.
