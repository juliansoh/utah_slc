## Question:
I need to know what paperwork I would need to get my money back for the plates I paid for?

## Answer:
To request a refund for the fees paid for license plates, you need to follow the specific guidelines set by the Utah DMV. Here are the steps and paperwork required:

1. **Eligibility**: Refunds are granted only under limited circumstances. For example:
   - If you renewed a vehicle that was already sold by mistake, you need to provide a bill of sale with the sale date, VIN, and seller and purchaser information. The sale date must be prior to the renewal date.
   - If you paid renewal fees for a vehicle that was sold, traded-in, or became inoperable before the registration period ended, you need to provide proof of this.

2. **Documentation**:
   - **Bill of Sale**: Include details such as the date of sale, vehicle identification number (VIN), and information about the seller and purchaser.
   - **Proof of Sale/Trade-In/Inoperability**: If applicable, provide documents that show the vehicle was sold, traded-in, or became inoperable before the new registration period began. Requests must be made within six months of the payment date.

3. **Submission**:
   - **Complete a Refund Request Form**: Visit the Utah Motor Vehicle Portal (MVP) to submit your refund request.
   - **Supporting Documentation**: Attach the required supporting documents as mentioned above.
   - **Processing Time**: Allow 6-8 weeks for the processing of your request. The DMV will review your documentation and decide whether to approve or deny the refund. If approved, a refund check will be mailed to the provided address. If denied, you will receive a letter explaining the reason for the denial.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the sections on requesting a refund on the Utah DMV website [doc2][doc3].
