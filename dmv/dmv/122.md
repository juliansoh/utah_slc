## Question:
"I am military, do I get an exemption?"
## Answer:
Yes, as a member of the military, you may qualify for certain exemptions when registering your vehicle in Utah:

1. **Property Tax/Age-Based Fee Exemption**: If you are a Utah resident currently serving in the military and stationed outside of Utah, you may qualify for an exemption from property tax/age-based fees when your vehicle is located with you out-of-state. To qualify for this exemption, you need to provide:
   - Military Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) to verify your resident state.
   - Military Orders or documentation on military letterhead to verify your assignment location [doc1].

2. **Sales/Use Tax Exemption**: Active-duty military personnel stationed in Utah, whose legal residence is in another state, are permitted to register their motor vehicles in their state of legal residence. However, if you purchase a vehicle in Utah and plan to operate it in the state, you must pay the sales/use tax on the vehicle, even if you choose to register it in your home state [doc2].
